# Moore's Expanded Outcomes Framework
## Primary Taxonomy for CME Learning Objectives

**Purpose:** Primary framework for learning objectives and outcomes measurement. Replaces Bloom's as primary taxonomy; Bloom's may be used secondarily for cognitive complexity clarification only.

---

## Framework Overview

Moore's Expanded Outcomes Framework provides seven levels of educational outcomes, progressing from basic participation through community-level health impact. Unlike Bloom's taxonomy (which focuses on cognitive processes), Moore's Framework focuses on **measurable outcomes at the point of care and beyond**.

## Bloom's Integration (Secondary Use Only)

Bloom's cognitive taxonomy may be used ONLY to add specificity within Moore's levels. **Never substitute Bloom's level for Moore's level.**

| Moore Level | Bloom's Enhancement | When to Use |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 3A Declarative | Remember, Understand | Clarify cognitive process expected |
| 3B Procedural | Apply | Clarify skill application context |
| 4 Competence | Analyze, Evaluate | Clarify clinical reasoning complexity |
| 5 Performance | Create (plans) | Clarify treatment planning expectations |

**Correct usage:** "Level 5 (Performance) objective requiring Bloom's Evaluate-level reasoning"

**Incorrect usage:** "Bloom's Level 4 (Analyze)" without Moore's context

## Rejected Objective Types

**DO NOT USE these objective patterns:**

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "Understand the mechanism of..." | Passive, unmeasurable | "Explain to patients how..." |
| "Appreciate the importance of..." | Attitudinal, unmeasurable | "Implement screening for..." |
| "Be aware of..." | Passive, no action | "Identify patients who..." |
| "Learn about..." | Process-focused | "Apply criteria to select..." |
| "Review the guidelines for..." | No clinical action | "Prescribe according to..." |
| "Discuss options with patients" | Vague | "Counsel using shared decision-making framework to..." |

---

## Gap-to-Objective Alignment

Every learning objective must trace to an identified gap:

| Gap Type | Moore Level Target | Objective Focus |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Knowledge gap | 3A/3B → 4 | Build knowledge, verify competence |
| Competence gap | 4 | Case practice, simulation |
| Performance gap | 5 | Practice change commitment |
| Outcome gap | 5 → 6 | Performance leading to outcomes |

---

## Quality Criteria for Objectives

- [ ] 60%+ of objectives at Level 4 or higher
- [ ] Every identified gap addressed by ≥1 objective
- [ ] Every objective has measurement at ≥2 timepoints
- [ ] Every objective explicitly links to patient outcome
- [ ] No passive verbs (understand, appreciate, be aware)
- [ ] No unmeasurable outcomes
- [ ] Action verbs match Moore level
- [ ] Point-of-care action is explicit

---

*This framework must be included in context for Learning Objectives Agent and all agents that reference outcomes.*
