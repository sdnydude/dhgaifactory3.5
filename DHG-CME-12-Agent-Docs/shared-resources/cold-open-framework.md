# Cold Open Framework
## 60 Minutes-Style Narrative Hooks for CME Documents

**Purpose:** Humanize clinical topics using narrative hooks that create emotional engagement before statistics appear. The character introduced becomes a narrative thread throughout all documents.

---

## What Is a Cold Open?

A cold open is a 50-100 word narrative that drops the reader into a specific moment—a patient's experience, a clinician's decision point, or a moment of consequence. It humanizes the clinical gap before any statistics appear, creating emotional investment in the educational need.

Think of how 60 Minutes opens a segment: a person, a moment, stakes that matter. Then the turn to the bigger picture.

## Cold Open Types

### 1. Patient-Centered
A patient experiencing the consequence of the educational gap. Shows what happens when care falls short.

**Best for:** Disease management gaps, treatment delays, diagnostic failures

### 2. Clinician-Centered
A physician or healthcare provider facing the decision point where education fails them. Shows the challenge from the provider's perspective.

**Best for:** Complex decision-making gaps, time pressure, competing priorities

### 3. Moment of Consequence
The specific instant where the gap becomes harm. Frozen in the critical moment.

**Best for:** Urgent conditions, preventable emergencies, safety issues

### 4. Diagnostic Odyssey
The journey through a system that fails to recognize. Shows the accumulated cost of delay.

**Best for:** Rare diseases, conditions with long diagnostic delays, missed patterns

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Cardiology (Patient-Centered)

> Maria Chen, 58, sits in her cardiologist's waiting room for the third time this year. Each visit follows the same pattern: shortness of breath, a medication adjustment, a promise to do better with salt. What neither she nor her physician realizes is that her ejection fraction has dropped below 30% and she now qualifies for a device that could cut her mortality risk in half. Across the country, 380,000 patients like Maria are waiting for a conversation that never happens.

**Character:** Maria Chen, 58
**Type:** Patient-centered
**Humanizing detail:** Third visit this year, same pattern
**Stakes:** Qualifies for life-saving device, doesn't know it
**Turn:** "380,000 patients like Maria"

---

### Example 2: Oncology (Clinician-Centered)

> Dr. James Okafor has eleven minutes. His 62-year-old patient, a former smoker who quit eight years ago, is here for a diabetes check. The EMR flags seventeen overdue preventive items. Lung cancer screening is not one of them. In four months, this patient will present to the emergency department with a cough that will not quit. The CT will show stage IIIB disease. Dr. Okafor will wonder what he missed. He missed nothing. The system never prompted him to ask.

**Character:** Dr. James Okafor
**Type:** Clinician-centered
**Humanizing detail:** Eleven minutes, seventeen overdue items
**Stakes:** Will miss lung cancer that could have been caught
**Turn:** "He missed nothing. The system never prompted him to ask."

---

### Example 3: Diabetes (Moment of Consequence)

> The text arrives at 2:47 AM: "Glucose 43 mg/dL." Rachel Torres, 34, is already seizing. Her husband calls 911 while their six-year-old watches from the hallway. Rachel has lived with type 1 diabetes for twenty years. She has never heard the phrase "time in range." Her endocrinologist has never shown her a CGM report. She manages her disease the way she was taught in 2004: fingersticks, carb counting, correction doses. The technology to prevent this night exists. The education to use it does not.

**Character:** Rachel Torres, 34
**Type:** Moment of consequence
**Humanizing detail:** Six-year-old watching from the hallway
**Stakes:** Seizing from hypoglycemia, preventable with modern tools
**Turn:** "The technology to prevent this night exists. The education to use it does not."

---

### Example 4: Rheumatology (Diagnostic Odyssey)

> David Kimura first mentioned the back pain to his doctor at 24. He was told to stretch more. At 26, an orthopedist found nothing on X-ray. At 29, a chiropractor blamed his posture. At 33, an MRI finally revealed what had been there all along: inflammation at the sacroiliac joints, the hallmark of axial spondyloarthritis. Nine years. Four providers. One diagnosis that could have been made on the first visit if anyone had asked three questions. David's story is not unusual. It is average.

**Character:** David Kimura
**Type:** Diagnostic odyssey
**Humanizing detail:** Age progression (24, 26, 29, 33)
**Stakes:** Nine years of unnecessary suffering
**Turn:** "David's story is not unusual. It is average."

## The Narrative Thread Requirement

**CRITICAL:** The character introduced in the cold open must reappear throughout all documents. This creates emotional continuity and reminds reviewers that real patients are affected.

### Required Appearances

| Document Section | How to Reference |
|------------------|------------------|
| Disease State Overview | "Maria Chen is one of 6.7 million Americans living with..." |
| Gap Analysis | "In Maria's case, the gap manifested as..." |
| Gap Description | "For patients like Maria..." |
| Educational Rationale | "Had Maria's cardiologist participated in education addressing these gaps..." |
| Curriculum Design | "Cases modeled on patients like Maria will present..." |
| Expected Outcomes | "Success means the next Maria receives timely intervention." |

### Minimum Appearances: 4 sections

## Character Creation Guidelines

### Naming
- Use common first and last names appropriate to the therapeutic area's demographics
- Include age
- One humanizing detail that makes them real

### Character Information Template
```
Name: [First] [Last]
Age: [Number]
Type: [patient | clinician]
Humanizing Detail: [Specific, concrete detail]
Clinical Situation: [The gap they represent]
```

### Examples of Humanizing Details
- The six-year-old watching from the hallway
- Third visit this year with the same complaint
- Eleven minutes before the next patient
- Quit smoking eight years ago
- Four providers over nine years

## Cold Open Rules

### DO:
1. Use composite characters (note this if asked about methodology)
2. Write in present tense for immediacy
3. Include one specific detail that makes the person real
4. End with the turn to scale (connect individual to population)
5. Keep to 50-100 words exactly

### DO NOT:
1. Include statistics in the cold open itself
2. Use medical jargon the reader must translate
3. Hedge with "may" or "might"
4. Name real patients or identifiable individuals
5. Make the character a stereotype
6. Exceed 100 words

## Cold Open Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any cold open:

- [ ] Present tense throughout
- [ ] 50-100 words exactly
- [ ] Named character with age
- [ ] One humanizing detail included
- [ ] Stakes are clear and high
- [ ] Turn connects to systemic scope
- [ ] No statistics in the cold open
- [ ] No medical jargon
- [ ] No hedging language
- [ ] Character can reappear as narrative thread

---

## Integration with Needs Assessment

The cold open is the first element of the Needs Assessment document. It appears:
- With no header
- Before any statistics
- Followed by a transition paragraph that connects to population data

### Example Transition
After the cold open about Maria Chen:

> Maria Chen is one of 6.7 million Americans living with heart failure, a number projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. Her story—repeated in waiting rooms across the country—illustrates the persistent gap between what evidence supports and what patients receive.

---

*This framework must be included in context for the Needs Assessment Agent and referenced by all agents that produce narrative content.*
