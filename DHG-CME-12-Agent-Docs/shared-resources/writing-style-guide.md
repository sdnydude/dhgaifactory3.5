- **Persuasive** but not promotional

---

## Prose Requirements

### Density Standards

## Banned Patterns (AI Tells)

### NEVER USE These Patterns:

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Use Instead |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Em dashes (—) | AI overuses them | Comma, colon, or parentheses |
| Colons in titles | Generic "Topic: Subtitle" format | Full sentence titles |
| "It's important to note that" | Filler phrase | Just state it directly |
| "Delve into" or "delve deeper" | AI cliché | Examine, explore, investigate |
| "In today's healthcare landscape" | Generic opener | Specific timeframe or delete |
| "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally" | Mechanical transitions (esp. as paragraph starters) | Vary transitions or delete |
| "This is particularly relevant because" | Unnecessary framing | Delete, integrate relevance |
| "It is worth noting" | Filler | Just note it |
| "In conclusion" or "To summarize" | Unnecessary signposting | Delete |
| "A myriad of" or "a plethora of" | Pretentious | Many, numerous, specific number |
| "Underscores the importance" | Cliché | Demonstrates, reveals, shows |
| "Serves as a testament to" | Cliché | Demonstrates, proves |
| "Navigate the complexities" | Vague | Be specific about complexity |
| "One might argue" or "Some may say" | Weak hedging | Make direct assertion |
| "Robust" (as generic intensifier) | Overused | Delete or be specific |
| "Landscape" (outside literal geography) | AI cliché | Delete or rephrase |
| "Leverage" (as verb) | Corporate jargon | Use, employ, apply |
| "Holistic" | Overused | Comprehensive, integrated |
| "Paradigm" or "paradigm shift" | Dated | Change, transformation |
| "Cutting-edge" or "state-of-the-art" | Generic | Recent, advanced, specific date |
| "Best practices" | Vague | Recommended approaches, guidelines |
| "Moving forward" | Filler | Delete |
| "At the end of the day" | Cliché | Delete |
| "It goes without saying" | Then don't say it | Delete |

### Additional Pattern Rules
- **No repeated sentence starters** - Vary openings
- **No rhetorical questions followed by immediate answers** - Predictable pattern
- **Limit excessive hedging** - "may," "might," "could potentially" undermine authority

---

## Required Patterns

### Active Voice
Target **80%+ active voice** throughout.

| Passive (Avoid) | Active (Use) |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "Medications were prescribed by clinicians" | "Clinicians prescribed medications" |
| "The diagnosis was delayed" | "Physicians delayed the diagnosis" |
| "Treatment was initiated" | "The team initiated treatment" |

### Specific Numbers
| Vague (Avoid) | Specific (Use) |
|---------------|----------------|
| "Many patients" | "43% of patients" |
| "A significant number" | "12,000 participants" |
| "Recently" | "In 2024" |

### Strong Verbs
| Weak (Avoid) | Strong (Use) |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Increased significantly" | "Surged" or "climbed 47%" |
| "Is very important" | "Drives," "determines," "shapes" |
| "Has a negative effect" | "Undermines," "impairs," "disrupts" |

### Named Studies
| Generic (Avoid) | Specific (Use) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Research shows" | "The PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated" |
| "Studies indicate" | "A 2024 JAMA analysis of 15,000 patients found" |
| "Evidence suggests" | "Registry data from the ACC PINNACLE program reveal" |

---

## Sentence Variety Technique

Vary openings across these patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Subject first** | "Clinicians face unprecedented challenges..." |
| **Time first** | "Over the past decade, treatment options..." |
| **Place first** | "In community practice settings, the reality..." |
| **Condition first** | "When patients present with multiple comorbidities..." |
| **Contrast first** | "Despite guideline recommendations..." |
| **Evidence first** | "A 2024 analysis of 12,000 patients revealed..." |
| **Number first** | "Forty-three percent of eligible patients..." |

---

## Title Formatting Rules

### NO COLONS IN TITLES
Exception: Only acceptable when title creates genuine **cognitive dissonance** (unexpected juxtaposition that demands resolution).

### What Cognitive Dissonance Means for Titles
Two ideas create psychological tension that demands resolution. The juxtaposition must be unexpected, provocative, and make the reader need to learn more.

### Examples

**BAD Titles (lazy colon use):**
- "Heart Failure: New Approaches to Management"
- "SGLT2 Inhibitors: A Clinical Update"
- "Diabetes Care: Optimizing Outcomes"

**GOOD Titles (no colon needed):**
- "When Guideline-Concordant Care Fails Heart Failure Patients"
- "The SGLT2 Revolution Primary Care Missed"
- "Why Half Your Diabetic Patients Never Reach Goal"

**ACCEPTABLE Colon Use (true cognitive dissonance):**
- "Less Is More: Why Deprescribing Saves Lives"
- "The Diagnosis That Wasn't: Nine Years to Spondyloarthritis"
- "First, Do No Harm: When Aggressive Treatment Kills"

---

## Data Integration

### BAD (list-style):
```
The prevalence is significant:
- 34 million Americans affected
- $327 billion annual cost
- 50% undiagnosed
```

### GOOD (prose-style):
```
An estimated 34 million Americans live with this condition, generating 
$327 billion in annual healthcare costs. Nearly half remain undiagnosed, 
representing a substantial population whose disease progresses silently 
toward preventable complications.
```

---

## Writing Examples

### BAD (AI-style):
> "It is important to note that cardiovascular disease remains a significant concern in the United States. Furthermore, many patients are not adequately managed. This underscores the importance of continued medical education for healthcare providers. Additionally, new treatment options have emerged that may potentially improve outcomes."

**Problems:** "Important to note," "Furthermore" opener, "many patients" (vague), "underscores the importance," "Additionally" opener, excessive hedging ("may potentially").

### GOOD (Professional medical writing):
> "Cardiovascular disease claims one American life every 33 seconds. Despite three decades of statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and lifestyle intervention campaigns, 48% of U.S. adults carry at least one major cardiovascular risk factor, and fewer than half achieve their lipid targets. The treatment landscape shifted dramatically in 2023 when inclisiran reached the market, yet prescribing data from the first 18 months reveal that fewer than 8% of eligible patients have received it. This gap between therapeutic availability and clinical adoption represents precisely the kind of barrier that well-designed continuing medical education can address."

**Why it works:**
- Opens with arresting statistic (one death every 33 seconds)
- Specific numbers throughout (48%, 33 seconds, 8%)
- Names specific drugs and timeframes
- Active voice throughout
- Varied sentence length (6 words to 31 words)
- No hedging: makes direct claims with implied evidence
- Builds to clear conclusion about educational opportunity
- Zero em dashes, zero "furthermore," zero "it is important to note"
