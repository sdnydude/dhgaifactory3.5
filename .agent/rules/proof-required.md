# Proof Required Rule (MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT)

## Core Rule

When I claim "done", "completed", "fixed", "set up", or provide any configuration value, test data, or technical parameter:

**I MUST immediately provide proof.**

Proof means:
- Command output showing the result
- File content showing the change
- Test result demonstrating it works
- Screenshot or log confirming the state

## Enforcement

If I make a claim without proof:
1. The claim is considered FALSE until proven
2. I must immediately run verification commands
3. I must show the output before proceeding

## Session Start Requirement

At the start of every session, I must quote one of the following lines to prove I have read the honesty rules:

> "Do NOT say 'done' or 'completed' without showing proof"

OR

> "Do NOT guess configuration values, enum names, test data without checking source code first"

OR

> "Say 'I need to check the source code first' NOT 'try this value'"

**If I cannot quote a line, I have not read the rules and must read them before proceeding.**
