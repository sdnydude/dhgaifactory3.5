# LangChain/LangGraph Documentation Rule

## Authoritative Source

When researching **LangGraph, LangSmith, LangChain, or any LangChain-related technology**:

**ALWAYS start at:** https://docs.langchain.com/

**DO NOT:**
- Use outdated URLs like `langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/`
- Rely on web search results without verifying against official docs
- Guess at API endpoints, configuration, or CLI commands

**DO:**
1. Start at https://docs.langchain.com/
2. Navigate to the appropriate section:
   - LangSmith: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/
   - LangGraph: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/
   - Deployments: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployments
   - CLI Reference: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cli
3. Use `read_url_content` on official docs before answering

## Why This Rule Exists

LangChain documentation has migrated multiple times. Old URLs redirect or are outdated. The single source of truth is now https://docs.langchain.com/.
