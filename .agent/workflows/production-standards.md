# Production Standards

These rules are mandatory for all code work.

## 1. Code Quality Requirements

- All code must be production-ready
- No stubs, no truncated files, no skeleton code
- No minimal installs that are broken
- No disabled installations waiting for other installs
- Every file must be complete

## 2. Workflow Requirements

A. Read and follow master instructions
B. Review and use server-first agent workflow properly (all work on 10.0.0.251)
C. Never propose a package or feature as a "solution" - implement it fully
D. Apply debug master instructions and placeholder rules

## 3. Debugging Protocol

A. STOP before attempting random fixes
B. REFLECT on the actual problem
C. RESEARCH the issue using:
   - Factory documentation on .251
   - Package documentation of connected apps
   - Web resources
   - Reddit and community sources
   - Package documentation of the broken project
D. NEVER attempt the same failed debugging method twice

## 4. Accountability

- Business launch and operational success depend on code quality
- Production code only - no exceptions
- No placeholders, no TODOs, no FIXMEs
- No truncated or partial files

## Acknowledgment

By invoking /production-standards, I confirm these instructions are my operating standard for this session.
