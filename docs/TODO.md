## P2: Support Agent Endpoints

### Next Agents to Implement
**Priority Order:**
1. **Outcomes Agent** - Measure CME effectiveness (Moore Level 5-7)
2. **QA/Compliance Agent** - ACCME compliance checking
3. **Scribe Agent** - Documentation generation
4. **Remaining agent stubs** - Fill in as needed

**Notes:**
- Orchestrator has 1 stub endpoint (non-NEEDS_ASSESSMENT tasks)
- Research has 1 stub endpoint (direct source queries beyond Perplexity/PubMed)
- Both are acceptable for current functionality
