# DHG White Paper Style Guide & Standards

> **RULE:** This guide governs all white paper content generation. Review before writing.

## 1. Operating Protocols (Anti-Laziness)
- **Zero Truncation**: Never replace deep content with summaries during a rewrite.
- **Verification Mandatory**: If the user names a tool (e.g., "Nano Banana Pro"), YOU MUST SEARCH IT. Never assume it is a typo.
- **Code Fidelity**: When generating prompts for other models, forbid copy editing.

## 2. Narrative Strategy: "The Digital Workforce"
- **Metaphor**: AI is not software; it is **Talent**.
- **Action**: We do not "install" AI; we **"onboard"** or **"hire"** agents.
- **management**: Humans are **"Strategic Leaders"** managing a digital team.

## 3. Character Registry (Personas)
Always refer to agents by name and role.
- **Doc**: Research Scientist (The academic, cites sources)
- **Sage**: Medical Director (The writer, patient-centric tone)
- **Ace**: Compliance Officer (The auditor, strict, adversarial)
- **Prof**: Curriculum Designer (The pedagogue, Bloom's Taxonomy)
- **Chart**: Outcomes Analyst (The measurement expert)
- **Lens**: Creative Director (Visuals, graphics)
- **Director**: Production Lead (Logistics, run-of-show)
- **Script**: Teleprompter Lead (Speech cadence)
- **Clip**: Post-Production Editor (Social clips, pacing)

## 4. Audience Accessibility
- **The "Business Reader" Rule**: Assume the reader is a CEO, not an engineer.
- **Jargon Explainer**: Every technical term (LLM, RAG, Docker) or industry term (CME, Needs Assessment) must be followed by a parenthetical plain-English explanation on first use.
- **Example**: "Needs Assessment (**the document justifying why education is needed**)..."

## 5. Visual Standards
- **Generator**: Nano Banana Pro (Google Gemini 3 Pro).
- **Style**: High-fidelity, 4K, photorealistic-meets-illustrative.
- **Requirement**: Legible text in charts; consistent characters across images.
