## How to Have a Conversation

**Start broad, then refine:**

**You:** "I need to design a CME curriculum on hypertension management for nurse practitioners."

**Agent:** Will ask clarifying questions about:
- Target audience experience level
- Learning gaps to address
- Activity format (webinar, workshop, course)
- Duration
- Compliance mode (CME vs non-CME)

**You:** Provide details, and the agent will generate a complete curriculum with objectives, mappings, and outline.

**Then refine:**
- "Add more focus on resistant hypertension"
- "Map these to Moore Level 5 (performance change)"
- "Generate a faculty brief for this curriculum"
- "Create pre/post assessments"

## Compliance Modes

### CME Mode
- Strict ACCME standards
- Moore Levels 3-7 focus (learning → practice change)
- ICD-10 and QI measure mappings required
- Assessment plan required
- Faculty disclosure required

### Non-CME Mode
- Flexible educational standards
- All Moore Levels acceptable
- ICD-10/QI mappings optional
- Assessment plan optional
- Less stringent documentation

**Specify your mode in the first prompt:**
- "Design a **CME curriculum** on..." → CME mode
- "Design a **training curriculum** on..." → Non-CME mode

## Moore Levels Explained

The agent maps objectives to these educational outcome levels:

| Level | Name | Focus | Example |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Participation | Attendance | "Attended diabetes CME webinar" |
| 2 | Satisfaction | Learner satisfaction | "Rated course 4.5/5 stars" |
| 3 | Learning (Declarative) | Knowledge gain | "Can list 5 signs of heart failure" |
| 4 | Competence | Skill demonstration | "Can interpret an ECG correctly" |
| 5 | Performance | Practice change | "Prescribes statins per guidelines" |
| 6 | Patient Health | Patient outcomes | "Patient LDL improved by 30%" |
| 7 | Community Health | Population outcomes | "County stroke mortality decreased 10%" |

**CME activities should target Levels 3-7**, with emphasis on Levels 5-7 for maximum impact.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about the topic** - "diabetes management" vs "diabetes"
2. **Define the audience clearly** - specialty, experience level, practice setting
3. **Identify learning gaps** - what knowledge/skill deficits exist?
4. **Specify the format** - webinar, workshop, online course, etc.
5. **State duration** - 30 min, 1 hour, 90 min, multi-session
6. **Mention compliance mode** - CME or non-CME
7. **Request specific components** - outline, brief, assessments
8. **Use iterative refinement** - review output, then ask for adjustments
