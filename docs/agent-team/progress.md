### Work Done
- Ran session startup checks (all containers healthy)
- Disabled 4 agents per user request: Research, Curriculum, Outcomes, QA-Compliance
- Brainstormed agent UI options
- User selected B, C, E, D approach for UI
- Created initial task_plan.md with 70 tasks

### Session: 2026-02-03 17:20 (Continued)

### Work Done
- User backlogged project system - focus on agents first
- Searched project directory for 12 agent specs
- Found `DHG-CME-12-Agent-Docs/` with complete documentation
- Discovered all 12 agent specs (01-12), shared resources, technical specs
- Read README.md with implementation order guidance
- Restructured task_plan.md: Phases 1-4 → Backlog, new phases for agent implementation

### Discovery: Implementation Order
From DHG-CME-12-Agent-Docs/README.md:
1. Needs Assessment Agent (#5) - START HERE
2. Prose Quality Agent (#11) - Second
3. Remaining agents following dependency order

### Decisions Made
- #4: Backlog project system, implement agents first (2026-02-03)
- #5: Use DHG-CME-12-Agent-Docs as source of truth (2026-02-03)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Read `05-needs-assessment.md` agent spec in detail
- [ ] Read shared resources (writing-style-guide.md, cold-open-framework.md)
- [ ] Create implementation plan for Needs Assessment Agent
- [ ] Get user approval before implementing
