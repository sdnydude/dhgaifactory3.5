# DHG Company Definition

> **This is the canonical source of truth for what DHG is.**

---

## What DHG Is

**DHG is an AI company and recording studio** that creates media, original podcasts, videos, and other content.

We have special skills in CME (Continuing Medical Education), but **CME is one product line, not the entire business**.

---

## Business Lines

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AI Development** | Building AI tools, agents, and platforms |
| **Recording Studio** | Audio/video production facility |
| **Media Creation** | Original podcasts, videos, content |
| **CME Products** | ACCME-compliant medical education (one product) |

---

## CME Context

CME is treated like any other product with its specific compliance requirements:
- **ACCME compliance** required for CME content
- 300 hours of CME symposium video archives to process
- Research agents for medical content

**CME is NOT the business. It is ONE product that happens to have compliance requirements.**

---

## What We're Building

The DHG AI Factory platform should support:

1. **AI Development** - Multi-model integrations, agent frameworks
2. **Media Production** - Video transcription, content management
3. **Session Intelligence** - Cross-platform AI chat history, memory
4. **CME Tools** - Research agents, compliance tracking (as one feature set)
5. **Studio Operations** - Project management, asset storage

## Correct Framing

❌ **Wrong:** "DHG is a CME company building AI tools"

✅ **Correct:** "DHG is an AI company and recording studio with a CME product line"
