## 4. Case Scenarios

### CASE-01: Recognition Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 67-year-old woman presents with 6-week history of bilateral shoulder and hip pain/stiffness, worse in mornings. ESR 68, CRP 42. Primary care started naproxen with minimal improvement. Referred for 'possible RA' but RF/CCP negative.

**Decision Points:**
1. Given negative RF/CCP but elevated inflammatory markers, what is your differential diagnosis priority?
2. What single intervention would you implement immediately to help confirm PMR diagnosis?

**Teaching Points:**
- Classic PMR presentation may lack specific biomarkers but clinical pattern is diagnostic
- Therapeutic trial of prednisone remains gold standard for PMR confirmation
- Morning stiffness duration and bilateral proximal pattern distinguish from RA

### CASE-02: Complex Decision Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 72-year-old man with 3-month history of shoulder/hip pain, jaw claudication episodes, and recent visual disturbances. ESR 95, CRP 78. Temporal artery biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks but patient demands immediate treatment.

**Decision Points:**
1. How do you balance immediate GCA treatment needs against PMR diagnostic clarity?
2. Patient improves on high-dose steroids but biopsy returns negative - now what is your diagnosis and management?

**Teaching Points:**
- PMR-GCA overlap requires immediate high-dose steroid treatment regardless of biopsy timing
- Negative biopsy after steroid treatment doesn't rule out GCA when clinical presentation suggests it
- Skip lesions and treatment effects can cause false-negative biopsies

### CASE-03: Management Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 69-year-old woman diagnosed with PMR, excellent response to prednisone 15mg. Now 8 months later on 8mg daily, symptoms returning. Patient anxious about steroid side effects, requests 'natural alternatives.' ESR climbing from 12 to 34.

**Decision Points:**
1. Is this PMR flare, steroid withdrawal, or new condition - how do you differentiate?
2. Patient refuses dose increase due to weight gain concerns - what are your evidence-based alternatives?
3. How do you address her request for discontinuation given rising inflammatory markers?

**Teaching Points:**
- PMR flares during taper require temporary dose increase, not alternative therapies
- Rising inflammatory markers during taper indicate active disease, not withdrawal symptoms
- Methotrexate as steroid-sparing agent has limited evidence in PMR compared to tocilizumab

### Case Progression Rationale
Cases progress from classic recognition scenario through complex differential diagnosis to chronic management challenges. Each incorporates real-world barriers: Case 1 addresses biomarker limitations in diagnosis, Case 2 tackles PMR-GCA overlap complexity, and Case 3 confronts long-term management without clear biochemical guidance. Progression moves from diagnostic certainty to clinical ambiguity, reflecting actual practice challenges.

## 6. Innovation Section

The polymyalgia rheumatica curriculum represents a paradigm shift in rheumatology continuing medical education by addressing the fundamental challenge of diagnostic uncertainty in inflammatory conditions lacking specific biomarkers. Traditional CME approaches for PMR have relied heavily on didactic presentations of diagnostic criteria and treatment algorithms. While these methods transfer knowledge effectively, they fail to address the complex clinical reasoning required when patients present with overlapping symptoms that could indicate PMR, rheumatoid arthritis, or giant cell arteritis.

The Diagnostic Reasoning Cascade innovation serves as the curricular backbone, providing a structured framework that mirrors actual clinical decision-making processes. Unlike static diagnostic criteria lists, this cascade guides participants through dynamic decision trees that account for patient complexity, comorbidities, and the temporal evolution of symptoms. The framework explicitly addresses the reality that PMR diagnosis often emerges through therapeutic response rather than definitive testing, teaching participants to navigate this uncertainty with confidence while maintaining diagnostic vigilance.

Comparative Symptom Mapping represents a significant advancement in how clinicians learn to differentiate between inflammatory arthritides. This interactive tool moves beyond traditional symptom lists by creating visual, manipulable comparisons that highlight subtle but crucial differences in presentation patterns. Participants engage with side-by-side symptom profiles, laboratory findings, and response patterns, developing pattern recognition skills that transfer directly to clinical practice. The mapping tool addresses the common clinical scenario where patients present with features suggestive of multiple conditions, requiring nuanced clinical judgment rather than algorithmic application of criteria.

Patient Voice Testimony Integration transforms the typically clinical-centric approach to PMR education by incorporating authentic patient experiences at critical decision points throughout the curriculum. These testimonies, carefully selected and edited for educational impact, provide insights into the patient experience of delayed diagnosis, treatment side effects, and quality of life impacts that pure clinical data cannot convey. The innovation lies not simply in including patient stories, but in strategically placing these voices at moments when clinical decisions directly impact patient outcomes, creating emotional resonance that drives behavior change.

The virtual symposium format itself represents an innovation in delivery methodology, specifically designed to overcome the engagement challenges of traditional virtual CME. Rather than adapting in-person formats for virtual delivery, this curriculum was conceived for the virtual environment, leveraging breakout rooms for peer consultation, real-time polling for immediate feedback, and shared documents for collaborative problem-solving. The format recognizes that effective virtual learning requires more frequent interaction, shorter content segments, and multiple modalities of engagement to maintain attention and promote retention.

Perhaps most significantly, the curriculum addresses the gap between knowledge acquisition and practice implementation through embedded accountability mechanisms. The peer accountability partner system, established during the final module, creates ongoing relationships that extend beyond the formal educational session. Participants commit to specific practice changes and receive follow-up contact from their accountability partner, dramatically increasing the likelihood of sustained behavior change compared to traditional post-session evaluation approaches.

The assessment strategy represents another innovation, moving from traditional post-test knowledge checks to competency validation exercises that simulate real clinical decision-making under time pressure. These assessments capture not just what participants know, but how quickly and accurately they can apply that knowledge in simulated clinical scenarios, providing more meaningful feedback about clinical readiness.
