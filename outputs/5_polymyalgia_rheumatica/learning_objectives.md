# Learning Objectives Document: Polymyalgia Rheumatica CME Activity

## Executive Summary

**Target Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Primary Audience:** Rheumatologists and Internal Medicine Physicians  
**Total Objectives:** 8  

**Moore Level Distribution:**
- Level 4 (Competence): 3 objectives (37.5%)
- Level 5 (Performance): 5 objectives (62.5%)

This distribution prioritizes performance-level outcomes to drive immediate practice changes while building essential competencies for complex clinical decision-making in polymyalgia rheumatica management.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Temporal Artery Examination Implementation
**Moore Level 5 (Performance) - Verb: Initiate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to initiate standardized temporal artery examination protocols for patients presenting with PMR symptoms to reduce risk of undiagnosed giant cell arteritis.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inadequate GCA screening in PMR patients, targeting the critical need for systematic screening to prevent vision loss and vascular complications.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days. Success criteria: ≥70% report implementing standardized temporal artery examination protocols.

---

### 2. Evidence-Based Corticosteroid Prescribing
**Moore Level 5 (Performance) - Verb: Prescribe**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to prescribe evidence-based corticosteroid tapering schedules for newly diagnosed PMR patients to minimize adverse effects while maintaining disease control.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses suboptimal corticosteroid management strategies, targeting inappropriate dosing and tapering that leads to prolonged steroid exposure and complications.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days. Success criteria: ≥70% report implementing structured tapering protocols based on current evidence.

---

### 3. Inflammatory Marker Monitoring
**Moore Level 5 (Performance) - Verb: Order**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to order appropriate inflammatory marker monitoring schedules for PMR patients to guide treatment adjustments and detect disease relapse.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inconsistent disease monitoring practices, targeting inadequate use of objective measures for disease activity assessment and treatment response.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days. Success criteria: ≥70% report implementing systematic inflammatory marker monitoring protocols.

---

### 4. Bone Health Protection Protocol Implementation
**Moore Level 5 (Performance) - Verb: Implement**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to implement bone health protection protocols for PMR patients initiating corticosteroid therapy to prevent osteoporotic fractures.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses insufficient preventive care for steroid-induced complications, targeting the gap in proactive bone health management leading to preventable osteoporotic complications.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days. Success criteria: ≥70% report implementing systematic bone health assessments and prophylaxis protocols.

---

### 5. Rheumatology Referral Optimization
**Moore Level 5 (Performance) - Verb: Refer**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to refer appropriate PMR patients for rheumatology consultation to optimize complex case management and reduce diagnostic delays.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses delayed or inappropriate specialist referrals, targeting suboptimal referral patterns that delay optimal care for complex PMR presentations.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days. Success criteria: ≥70% report implementing structured referral criteria for complex PMR cases.

---

### 6. Differential Diagnosis Competence
**Moore Level 4 (Competence) - Verb: Differentiate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to differentiate polymyalgia rheumatica from inflammatory arthritis, malignancy, and fibromyalgia using clinical presentation patterns and laboratory findings for patients with bilateral shoulder and hip girdle pain to reduce diagnostic delays and inappropriate treatments.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses delayed PMR diagnosis due to mimics, building competence in distinguishing PMR from common mimicking conditions that cause diagnostic delays.

**Measurement:** Case-based assessment with pre/post evaluation. Success criteria: ≥80% correct differential diagnosis on complex case scenarios.

---

### 7. Individualized Steroid Tapering Formulation
**Moore Level 4 (Competence) - Verb: Formulate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to formulate individualized steroid tapering schedules based on patient response patterns, comorbidities, and relapse risk factors for PMR patients to minimize steroid-related adverse effects while maintaining disease control.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inconsistent steroid tapering protocols, developing competence in creating evidence-based, individualized tapering strategies rather than using one-size-fits-all approaches.

**Measurement:** Case-based assessment with interactive simulations. Success criteria: ≥80% appropriate tapering decisions across varied patient scenarios.

---

### 8. Tocilizumab Candidacy Evaluation
**Moore Level 4 (Competence) - Verb: Evaluate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to evaluate candidacy for tocilizumab therapy by assessing steroid-dependence patterns, contraindications, and treatment response history for PMR patients to optimize steroid-sparing strategies.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses limited awareness of tocilizumab for steroid-sparing, building competence in identifying appropriate candidates and timing for tocilizumab introduction.

**Measurement:** Case-based assessment with candidate selection scenarios. Success criteria: ≥80% correct candidate selection and contraindication identification.
