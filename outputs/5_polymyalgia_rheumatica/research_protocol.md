# Research Protocol: Outcomes Evaluation of Polymyalgia Rheumatica Management CME Program for Rheumatologists

## 1. Protocol Summary

**Study Title:** Outcomes Evaluation of Polymyalgia Rheumatica Management CME Program for Rheumatologists

**Study Type:** Prospective single-arm educational outcomes study

**Study Design:** Single-arm pre-post with longitudinal follow-up

**Primary Endpoint:** Evidence-based PMR practice implementation

**Secondary Endpoints:** 
- PMR diagnostic competence score improvement
- Commitment-to-change completion rate  
- PMR knowledge retention

**Study Duration:** 6 months (3-month enrollment period + 90-day follow-up)

**Target Enrollment:** 120 participants

## 2. Background and Rationale

### 2.1 Educational Gap Summary

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) affects 1 in 133 people over age 50, yet diagnosis is frequently delayed due to clinical overlap with giant cell arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, steroid tapering practices vary widely among rheumatologists, leading to prolonged corticosteroid exposure and associated morbidity. Recent evidence supporting tocilizumab as steroid-sparing therapy represents a paradigm shift requiring targeted education to ensure appropriate implementation in clinical practice.

### 2.2 Rationale for Study

Educational outcomes research is essential for demonstrating CME effectiveness and continuous quality improvement. A single-arm pre-post design with 90-day follow-up is most appropriate for this CME outcomes study as it allows measurement across Moore levels 3-5 while remaining feasible within typical CME constraints.

### 2.3 Expected Contribution

This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of CME effectiveness in improving PMR management practices among rheumatologists, addressing critical gaps in differential diagnosis accuracy, standardization of steroid tapering protocols, and evidence-based utilization of biologic steroid-sparing therapy. Results will inform best practices for rheumatology CME design and contribute to the limited literature on Level 5 outcomes measurement in subspecialty continuing medical education.

## 3. Study Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of a case-based PMR management CME program in improving evidence-based steroid tapering practices and tocilizumab utilization among practicing rheumatologists at 3-month follow-up.

### 3.2 Secondary Objectives

1. To assess improvement in clinical competence for differential diagnosis of PMR from giant cell arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis using validated case scenarios
2. To evaluate knowledge retention of PMR diagnostic criteria and treatment algorithms at 3-month follow-up  
3. To measure participant commitment to implement specific practice changes in PMR steroid tapering protocols
4. To assess self-reported confidence in identifying appropriate tocilizumab candidates for steroid-sparing therapy

### 3.3 Exploratory Objectives

1. To identify practice setting and patient population factors that influence implementation of evidence-based PMR management
2. To explore barriers to adopting standardized steroid tapering protocols in routine rheumatology practice
3. To assess the relationship between years in practice and willingness to implement tocilizumab steroid-sparing strategies

## 4. Study Design and Methods

### 4.1 Study Design

**Design Type:** Single-arm pre-post with longitudinal follow-up

**Design Rationale:** This design enables assessment of knowledge gains, competence improvements, and practice change commitments with verification. A controlled design would be ideal but is not practical given the specialized audience and voluntary nature of CME participation. The longitudinal component is essential to capture the delayed impact of educational interventions on clinical practice patterns.

### 4.2 Study Duration

- **Enrollment Period:** 3 months
- **Follow-up Duration:** 90 days
- **Total Study Duration:** 6 months

## 5. Study Population

### 5.1 Inclusion Criteria

1. Board-certified or board-eligible rheumatologist
2. Currently managing patients with polymyalgia rheumatica
3. Minimum 5 PMR patients seen in past 6 months
4. Practicing in ambulatory care setting
5. Able to provide informed consent for research participation

### 5.2 Exclusion Criteria

1. Participated in PMR-focused CME in past 6 months
2. Not in active clinical practice with patient care responsibilities
3. Unable to complete electronic assessments
4. Primarily research-focused position without direct patient care

### 5.3 Sample Size Calculation

**Target N:** 120 participants

**Power Calculation:** Based on expected medium effect size (d=0.5) for knowledge and competence outcomes, alpha=0.05, power=0.80, we require 64 completers for paired t-test analysis. Accounting for 40% attrition by 90-day follow-up (consistent with CME literature), we will enroll 120 participants.

**Dropout Assumptions:** 40% attrition expected by 90-day follow-up based on CME outcomes research literature. Higher initial enrollment (120 vs minimum 107) accounts for potential early dropouts and ensures adequate power for subgroup analyses.

De-identified aggregate data may be shared with other researchers upon reasonable request. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant professional conferences.

## 11. Limitations

### 11.1 Study Design Limitations

1. **Single-arm design:** Lack of control group limits causal inferences about intervention effectiveness
2. **Self-selection bias:** Voluntary CME participation may attract more motivated learners
3. **Self-reported outcomes:** Practice implementation relies on participant self-report rather than objective measurement

### 11.2 Generalizability Limitations

1. **Sample characteristics:** Results may not generalize to non-rheumatologist providers who manage PMR
2. **Practice settings:** Focus on ambulatory care may limit applicability to other settings
3. **Geographic distribution:** Recruitment strategy may result in regional bias

### 11.3 Measurement Limitations

1. **Follow-up duration:** 90-day follow-up may not capture long-term practice changes
2. **Assessment burden:** Multiple assessments may contribute to participant fatigue and dropout
3. **Social desirability bias:** Participants may over-report positive practice changes
