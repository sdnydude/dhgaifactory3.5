## Case Scenarios

### Case 1: Recognition Challenge
**Patient**: 47-year-old female teacher with 3-month history of anxiety, insomnia, and weight loss attributed to work stress and divorce. TSH 0.1 mIU/L discovered on routine screening.

**Key Decision Points**:
- What additional history is critical given the delayed recognition?
- Which physical findings would you prioritize in your focused exam?
- What laboratory workup confirms Graves disease vs other causes?

**Teaching Points**: Nonspecific symptoms misattributed to psychosocial stressors; systematic hyperthyroid workup approach; primary care screening gaps

### Case 2: Management Complexity  
**Patient**: 32-year-old male software developer with 4-week palpitations and tremor attributed to caffeine intake. Wife notices prominent eyes and neck swelling. Free T4 4.2 ng/dL, TSI positive.

**Key Decision Points**:
- How do you address patient's attribution of symptoms to lifestyle factors?
- Given work demands (project launch in 2 weeks), how do you approach immediate management?
- What ophthalmologic evaluation is needed and how urgently?
- How do you counsel about work modifications while maintaining therapeutic alliance?

**Teaching Points**: Patient self-attribution delays recognition; balancing urgent treatment with life constraints; early ophthalmologic evaluation needs

### Case 3: Complex Decision Making
**Patient**: 58-year-old female with "borderline thyroid" (TSH 3.8 mIU/L) for 2 years presents with new atrial fibrillation. Current TSH <0.01 mIU/L but no classic hyperthyroid symptoms. Multiple comorbidities.

**Key Decision Points**:
- How do you reconcile absent symptoms with biochemical hyperthyroidism?
- What factors contributed to delayed recognition?
- How do you coordinate care with cardiology?
- What screening approach might have prevented this presentation?

**Teaching Points**: Subclinical progression to overt disease; atrial fibrillation as sole manifestation in older adults; comorbidities masking symptoms

## Innovation Section

This curriculum introduces three breakthrough innovations that address critical gaps in hyperthyroid disease education and clinical practice. The **Masked Case Progression** innovation fundamentally changes how complex cases are presented by withholding key diagnostic information initially, then revealing data points in the sequence that mirrors real clinical encounters. Unlike traditional case presentations that provide complete information upfront, this approach forces participants to make provisional diagnoses with incomplete data, then adjust their thinking as additional findings emerge. This methodology directly addresses the clinical reality where providers must make decisions with evolving information and uncertainty.

The **Real-Time Diagnostic Calibration** system represents a significant advance in medical education assessment. Rather than relying on post-session evaluation, this innovation provides immediate feedback on diagnostic accuracy while simultaneously benchmarking individual performance against peer cohorts. Participants receive instant data on how their diagnostic reasoning compares to colleagues with similar practice characteristics, creating a powerful learning loop that combines individual reflection with social learning. The system captures decision-making speed, accuracy, and reasoning quality, providing multi-dimensional performance analytics that help identify specific areas for improvement.

The **Symptom Attribution Reframing Exercises** innovation directly tackles one of the most significant barriers to timely hyperthyroid diagnosis: the tendency for both patients and providers to attribute symptoms to common conditions like stress, anxiety, or lifestyle factors. These structured exercises present cases where typical hyperthyroid symptoms are initially attributed to psychosocial or lifestyle factors, then guide participants through systematic reframing techniques. The exercises include specific tools for recognizing attribution bias, structured questioning approaches that explore alternative explanations, and decision-making frameworks that prevent premature diagnostic closure.

Together, these innovations create an educational experience that mirrors the complexity and uncertainty of real clinical practice while providing the structured support needed for skill development. The curriculum moves beyond traditional knowledge transfer to focus on the cognitive processes that enable accurate diagnosis in challenging circumstances. By addressing both individual cognitive biases and system-level screening gaps, this approach has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients with hyperthyroid disease while enhancing provider confidence in managing diagnostic uncertainty.
