## 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 2.1 Educational Gap
Despite clear American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for hyperthyroidism management, significant practice variation persists in both diagnostic differentiation and initial therapy selection. Previous studies demonstrate delayed recognition of Graves disease and inconsistent treatment choices between antithyroid drugs and radioactive iodine therapy.

### 2.2 Educational Need
Contemporary evidence indicates that endocrinologists require enhanced competency in:
- Systematic diagnostic workup protocols
- Risk stratification for treatment selection
- Implementation of guideline-recommended monitoring
- Patient counseling on treatment options

### 2.3 Rationale for Study
Educational outcomes research is essential for demonstrating CME effectiveness and continuous quality improvement. This study addresses the gap between published guidelines and clinical practice through systematic measurement of educational impact across Moore's levels 3-5.

### 2.4 Expected Contribution
This study will contribute novel evidence on the effectiveness of case-based CME for complex endocrine disorders and provide measurable data on practice change sustainability. Results will inform future CME program design for specialty audiences and contribute to the limited literature on Level 5 outcomes measurement in endocrinology continuing education.

### 3.2 Secondary Objectives
1. To assess improvement in clinical competence for differentiating Graves disease from toxic nodular goiter using standardized clinical vignettes
2. To evaluate knowledge retention of ATA guideline recommendations at 3-month follow-up
3. To measure participant commitment to specific practice changes and implementation rates at 6 months

### 3.3 Exploratory Objectives

## 4. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS

### 4.1 Study Design
Single-arm pre-post design with longitudinal follow-up

### 4.2 Design Rationale
A single-arm pre-post design with longitudinal follow-up is most appropriate for this CME outcomes study as it is pragmatic within operational constraints while providing meaningful evidence of educational impact. This design allows measurement across Moore levels 3-5 (learning, competence, and performance) without the logistical and ethical challenges of withholding education from a control group.

### 4.3 Study Setting
Multi-site recruitment through endocrinology professional associations, academic medical centers, and private practice networks

### 4.4 Study Duration
- Enrollment period: 3 months
- Follow-up duration: 90 days post-education
- Total study duration: 6 months

---

## 5. STUDY POPULATION

### 5.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Board-certified endocrinologist or endocrinology fellow in final year
2. Currently managing patients with hyperthyroid disease
3. Minimum 5 hyperthyroid patients seen per month
4. Access to electronic health records for practice verification
5. Willing to complete all study assessments

### 5.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Participated in formal hyperthyroid-focused CME within past 6 months
2. Not in active clinical practice with direct patient care
3. Unable to commit to 90-day follow-up period
4. Currently participating in other clinical education research

### 5.3 Sample Size Calculation
Sample size calculation based on detecting medium effect size (Cohen's d=0.5) with 80% power and alpha=0.05 requires 64 completed participants. Accounting for expected 40% attrition rate by final follow-up, we will enroll 160 participants (160 × 0.6 = 96 completers, exceeding minimum requirement).

### 5.4 Recruitment Strategy
- Professional society partnerships
- Academic medical center networks
- Direct invitation through CME providers
- Peer-to-peer referral
