# Learning Objectives Document
## Hyperthyroid Disease CME Program

### Executive Summary

**Target Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Primary Audience:** Endocrinologists and Internal Medicine physicians managing hyperthyroid patients

**Moore Level Distribution:**
- Level 4 (Competence): 3 objectives (37.5%)
- Level 5 (Performance): 5 objectives (62.5%)
- **Rationale:** Targeting Level 5 performance outcomes for endocrinologists based on gap barrier analysis, with supporting competence objectives for diagnostic and treatment selection skills.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Early Beta-Blocker Initiation (Level 5 - Performance)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **initiate** early beta-blocker therapy within 24 hours for patients presenting with symptomatic hyperthyroidism to reduce cardiovascular complications and symptom burden.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses delayed symptomatic management gap in prompt symptom control for newly diagnosed hyperthyroid patients.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with 60-day follow-up survey; Success target ≥70% implementing early beta-blocker protocols.

---

### 2. TSI Testing Implementation (Level 5 - Performance)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **order** thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) testing for patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease to enable personalized treatment duration decisions.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inconsistent biomarker utilization gap and underutilization of TSI testing for treatment personalization.

**Measurement:** Practice audit of laboratory orders with 60-day follow-up; Success target ≥75% routine TSI ordering for new Graves' patients.

---

### 3. Safety Monitoring Protocol Implementation (Level 5 - Performance)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **implement** standardized monitoring protocols for patients on antithyroid medications to detect and prevent serious adverse effects including agranulocytosis.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inadequate safety monitoring gap in detecting medication-related adverse events.

**Measurement:** Documentation review of monitoring protocols with 60-day follow-up; Success target ≥80% implementing structured monitoring systems.

---

### 4. Iodine Contrast Prophylaxis (Level 5 - Performance)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **prescribe** appropriate iodine contrast prophylaxis for hyperthyroid patients requiring CT imaging to prevent thyrotoxic crisis.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses iodine exposure management gaps and lack of systematic prophylaxis protocols.

**Measurement:** Chart review coordination with radiology departments; Success target ≥85% prescribing prophylaxis protocols.

---

### 5. Ophthalmology Referral Coordination (Level 5 - Performance)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **refer** patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy to specialized eye care within 2 weeks of diagnosis to optimize visual outcomes and prevent permanent complications.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses delayed ophthalmology referrals that result in irreversible vision complications.

**Measurement:** Referral tracking system monitoring time-to-specialist-evaluation; Success target ≥75% implementing expedited referral protocols.

---

### 6. Differential Diagnosis Skills (Level 4 - Competence)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **differentiate** Graves disease from other causes of hyperthyroidism using clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results in adult patients to reduce diagnostic delays and optimize treatment selection.

**Gap Alignment:** Builds competence addressing delayed recognition of Graves disease through systematic diagnostic evaluation.

**Measurement:** Pre/post case-based assessment with 30-day retention testing; Success target ≥80% correct diagnostic differentiation.

---

### 7. Treatment Selection Competence (Level 4 - Competence)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **select** optimal first-line treatment (antithyroid drugs vs radioactive iodine) based on patient-specific factors including age, comorbidities, pregnancy plans, and disease severity in hyperthyroid patients to improve treatment success rates.

**Gap Alignment:** Develops systematic treatment selection competence addressing inconsistent treatment choices between antithyroid drugs and radioactive iodine.

**Measurement:** Clinical decision-making cases with branching pathways; Success target ≥85% appropriate treatment selection.

---

### 8. Severity Assessment Skills (Level 4 - Competence)
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **evaluate** the severity of thyrotoxicosis using clinical signs, biochemical markers, and cardiovascular manifestations in hyperthyroid patients to determine urgency of treatment and monitoring frequency.

**Gap Alignment:** Enhances severity assessment competence to prevent progression to thyroid storm through early recognition.

**Measurement:** Pre/post severity classification scenarios with retention testing; Success target ≥80% accurate severity classification.
