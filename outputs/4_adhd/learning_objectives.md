### 2. Systematic Patient Monitoring
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **monitor** patients with ADHD using validated rating scales and cardiovascular assessments at appropriate intervals to ensure medication safety and efficacy.

**Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Gap Alignment:** Inadequate systematic monitoring practices  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days; success criterion ≥75% implementing systematic monitoring protocols

### 3. Medication Dosing Optimization
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **adjust** medication dosing and formulations for adult ADHD patients based on treatment response and tolerability profiles to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

**Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Gap Alignment:** Suboptimal dose titration practices  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days; success criterion ≥70% implementing individualized dosing strategies

### 4. Multimodal Treatment Coordination
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **refer** adult ADHD patients to appropriate psychosocial interventions based on comorbidity profiles and functional impairment severity to enhance comprehensive treatment outcomes.

**Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Gap Alignment:** Underutilization of multimodal treatment approaches  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days; success criterion ≥65% increased referrals to psychosocial interventions

### 5. Standardized Clinical Documentation
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **document** treatment rationale and patient response using standardized assessment tools for adult ADHD patients to improve care continuity and outcome tracking.

**Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Gap Alignment:** Inconsistent documentation and outcome measurement  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with follow-up at 60 days; success criterion ≥80% implementing standardized documentation protocols

### 6. Differential Diagnosis Competency
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **differentiate** ADHD presentation patterns from other psychiatric conditions in adult patients across diverse demographic groups to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment selection.

**Moore Level:** Level 4 (Competence)  
**Gap Alignment:** Underdiagnosis of adult ADHD  
**Measurement:** Pre/post case-based assessment with 30-day retention; success criterion ≥80% correct diagnostic reasoning

### 7. Risk-Benefit Assessment
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **assess** individual patient risk-benefit profiles to determine appropriate stimulant medication selection and dosing strategies for adult ADHD patients to optimize treatment outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.

**Moore Level:** Level 4 (Competence)  
**Gap Alignment:** Stimulant prescribing hesitancy  
**Measurement:** Pre/post case-based assessment with 30-day retention; success criterion ≥80% appropriate treatment selections

### 8. Culturally Responsive Care
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **evaluate** cultural and demographic factors influencing ADHD symptom presentation to formulate culturally responsive diagnostic and treatment plans for diverse patient populations to reduce healthcare disparities.

**Moore Level:** Level 4 (Competence)  
**Gap Alignment:** Racial and gender disparities in ADHD diagnosis  
**Measurement:** Pre/post case-based assessment with 30-day retention; success criterion ≥80% accurate identification of cultural factors

## Measurement Plan

### Primary Methods
- **Performance Level (Objectives 1-5):** Commitment-to-change surveys with 60-day follow-up and practice validation
- **Competence Level (Objectives 6-8):** Pre/post case-based assessments with 30-day retention testing

### Data Collection Timeline
- **Immediate:** Post-activity assessments and commitment-to-change declarations
- **30 days:** Retention testing for competence-level objectives
- **60 days:** Performance validation through practice change surveys and chart reviews

### Success Metrics
- Individual objective success criteria range from 65-80% achievement rates
- Aggregate performance target: >75% of participants meeting success criteria across all measured objectives
- Patient outcome validation through symptom improvement scores and functional measures at 90-day follow-up
