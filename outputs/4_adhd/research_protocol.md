# IRB-Ready Research Protocol: Outcomes Evaluation of Adult ADHD Diagnostic and Treatment CME Program for Psychiatrists

## 1. Protocol Summary

**Protocol Title:** Outcomes Evaluation of Adult ADHD Diagnostic and Treatment CME Program for Psychiatrists

**Principal Investigator:** [To be assigned]

**Study Design:** Prospective single-arm educational outcomes study with longitudinal follow-up

**Primary Objective:** To evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-modal CME intervention in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning performance for adult ADHD among practicing psychiatrists

**Study Population:** Licensed psychiatrists currently practicing in the United States

**Target Enrollment:** 150 participants

**Study Duration:** 6 months total (3-month enrollment period, 60-day follow-up)

**Primary Endpoint:** ADHD evidence-based practice implementation measured as proportion of participants implementing evidence-based ADHD assessment or treatment practices based on pre-specified commitments to change

## 2. Background and Rationale

### 2.1 Educational Gap Summary

Adult ADHD remains significantly underdiagnosed, with studies suggesting up to 80% of adults with ADHD remain undiagnosed. Psychiatrists report uncertainty in applying diagnostic criteria across diverse populations and hesitancy in prescribing stimulant medications due to concerns about misuse and regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, significant racial and gender disparities exist in ADHD diagnosis rates, with women and minority populations less likely to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### 2.2 Rationale for Study

Educational outcomes research is essential for demonstrating CME effectiveness and continuous quality improvement. The current literature on CME effectiveness for adult ADHD management is limited, particularly regarding measurement of both competence-level diagnostic skills and performance-level practice change commitments.

### 2.3 Expected Contribution

This study will contribute to the limited literature on CME effectiveness for adult ADHD management by measuring both competence-level diagnostic skills and performance-level practice change commitments. The focus on diagnostic accuracy across diverse populations addresses a critical equity gap in psychiatric education research. Results will inform development of evidence-based educational strategies to improve adult ADHD care quality and reduce diagnostic disparities.

## 3. Study Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-modal CME intervention in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning performance for adult ADHD among practicing psychiatrists.

### 3.2 Secondary Objectives

1. To assess change in clinical competence in applying DSM-5-TR criteria for adult ADHD diagnosis using standardized case scenarios
2. To measure knowledge retention of evidence-based treatment approaches for adult ADHD at 3-month follow-up
3. To evaluate self-reported confidence in diagnosing adult ADHD across diverse patient populations
4. To assess changes in perceived barriers to optimal adult ADHD diagnosis and treatment

### 3.3 Exploratory Objectives

1. To identify practice setting factors associated with greater implementation of learned diagnostic approaches
2. To examine relationships between baseline practice patterns and commitment-to-change goal achievement
3. To assess differential impact of the intervention on participants with varying baseline experience with adult ADHD patients

## 4. Study Design and Methods

### 4.1 Study Design

**Design Type:** Single-arm pre-post with longitudinal follow-up

**Design Rationale:** A single-arm pre-post design with 60-day follow-up was selected as the most appropriate methodology for this CME outcomes study. This design aligns with industry standards for educational intervention research while remaining feasible within typical CME operational constraints. The design allows for measurement across Moore levels 3-5, capturing immediate learning gains, competence improvement, and behavioral change commitments.

### 4.2 Study Duration

- **Enrollment Period:** 3 months
- **Follow-up Duration:** 60 days post-education (with additional 120-day sustainability assessment)
- **Total Duration:** 5 months

### 4.3 Sample Size Calculation

**Target N:** 150 participants

**Power Calculation:** Sample size calculation assumes a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5) for the primary learning outcome, with 80% power and alpha = 0.05, requiring 64 completed matched pairs for pre-post analysis. Accounting for 40% attrition by 60-day follow-up (consistent with CME outcomes literature), we require 107 baseline participants. To account for incomplete baseline assessments and additional dropout, we target 150 participants from the estimated 700 program attendees (21% enrollment rate).

**Dropout Assumptions:** Based on published CME outcomes research, we anticipate 40% participant attrition between baseline and 60-day follow-up. Primary reasons include survey fatigue, competing clinical demands, and email deliverability issues.
