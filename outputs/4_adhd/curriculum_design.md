## Case Scenarios

### Case 1: Maria - Adult ADHD Misdiagnosis Recognition
**Scenario Type:** Recognition  
**Patient:** 28-year-old Latina marketing executive presenting with "anxiety and depression" following workplace performance review. Chronic disorganization, missed deadlines, feeling overwhelmed by simple tasks. Previous therapists focused on mood symptoms. Family history includes 8-year-old son recently diagnosed with ADHD.

**Key Decision Points:**
- Efficient adult ADHD screening while addressing anxiety concerns
- Cultural and gender factors influencing symptom presentation and diagnostic approach

**Teaching Points:**
- Adult ADHD often presents as emotional dysregulation rather than hyperactivity
- Women and minorities frequently misdiagnosed with anxiety/depression first
- Family history significantly increases diagnostic probability

### Case 2: James - Treatment Selection Under Regulatory Pressure
**Scenario Type:** Management  
**Patient:** 35-year-old Black software engineer meeting ADHD criteria with mild hypertension and family substance use history. Recent DEA audit notice at clinic. Patient requests stimulant medication after online research.

**Key Decision Points:**
- Balancing evidence-based stimulant prescribing with regulatory concerns and potential bias
- Monitoring strategy addressing therapeutic goals and abuse potential while maintaining alliance

**Teaching Points:**
- Stimulants remain first-line treatment regardless of demographic factors
- Structured monitoring protocols reduce regulatory risk while optimizing care
- Avoiding appropriate treatment due to bias constitutes care disparity

### Case 3: Dr. Sarah Chen - Physician-Patient Complex Case
**Scenario Type:** Complex Decision  
**Patient:** 42-year-old emergency physician seeking consultation for "burnout and chronic fatigue." History of treated depression, current insomnia, lifelong attention difficulties worsened during residency. Self-medicates with caffeine and occasionally takes daughter's Adderall. Requests no ADHD documentation due to career concerns.

**Key Decision Points:**
- Addressing physician-patient with substance use, career concerns, and legitimate symptoms
- Ethical and practical considerations for documentation and treatment with selective recording requests

## Innovation Section

This curriculum introduces three groundbreaking innovations that collectively address systemic barriers to effective ADHD care while advancing the science of medical education in psychiatric specialties.

The **Bias-Aware Diagnostic Simulator** represents a paradigm shift in clinical decision-making training by incorporating implicit bias recognition directly into diagnostic reasoning exercises. Unlike traditional case-based learning that focuses primarily on clinical knowledge, this innovation uses machine learning algorithms to detect patterns in participant responses that suggest diagnostic bias based on patient demographic characteristics. The simulator presents identical clinical presentations with varied patient demographics, tracking decision-making differences in real-time. When bias patterns emerge, the system triggers immediate micro-learning modules that present research on health disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment. This approach transforms unconscious bias from an abstract concept into a tangible clinical skill that can be measured and improved. The innovation addresses the critical finding that women and minorities are systematically underdiagnosed with ADHD while being overdiagnosed with anxiety and depression, leading to years of ineffective treatment.

The **Patient Voice Integration** innovation fundamentally reimagines the role of lived experience in medical education by embedding authentic patient narratives throughout the diagnostic and treatment decision-making process. Rather than using actors or written vignettes, this system incorporates video testimonials, interactive patient avatars, and real-time patient feedback into clinical scenarios. Participants receive immediate input from patients who have experienced diagnostic delays, medication failures, or successful treatment outcomes that directly correspond to their clinical decisions. This creates an unprecedented level of empathy and patient-centeredness in clinical reasoning. The innovation includes a digital platform where patients with ADHD can share their experiences navigating the healthcare system, creating a continuously updated library of authentic perspectives that inform clinical education. This addresses the significant gap between clinical presentations as described in textbooks and the complex, real-world experiences of patients seeking ADHD care.

The **Regulatory Decision Tree Pathway** innovation tackles one of the most significant barriers to appropriate ADHD treatment: prescriber anxiety about DEA oversight and controlled substance regulations. This sophisticated decision-support tool guides clinicians through evidence-based prescribing decisions while simultaneously addressing regulatory compliance requirements. The pathway integrates current DEA guidelines, state-specific regulations, and institutional policies into clinical decision-making exercises, helping participants understand that appropriate medical care and regulatory compliance are complementary rather than competing priorities. The innovation includes mock audit scenarios where participants practice documentation and decision-making under regulatory scrutiny, building confidence in prescribing practices. Additionally, the system provides updates on evolving regulations and connects prescribers with regulatory experts for complex cases. This addresses the documented phenomenon of "regulatory anxiety" that leads many providers to avoid treating ADHD entirely or to systematically under-treat patients with appropriate medications.

These innovations work synergistically to create a comprehensive learning environment that addresses knowledge gaps, skill deficiencies, and systemic barriers simultaneously. The bias-aware simulator ensures diagnostic accuracy across diverse populations, patient voice integration ensures treatment decisions align with patient values and experiences, and regulatory pathway training ensures providers can deliver evidence-based care without inappropriate regulatory concerns. Together, they represent a new model for psychiatric medical education that acknowledges the complex interplay between clinical knowledge, unconscious bias, patient perspectives, and healthcare system constraints.

The expected impact extends beyond individual provider behavior change to influence healthcare system outcomes. By addressing bias in diagnostic reasoning, more patients will receive timely and accurate ADHD diagnoses. By integrating patient perspectives, treatment decisions will be more personalized and sustainable. By reducing regulatory anxiety, more providers will be willing to provide ADHD care, addressing current access barriers. The innovations also contribute to medical education science by providing new models for measuring and improving clinical reasoning in complex, bias-prone diagnostic categories.
