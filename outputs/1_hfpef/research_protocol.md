### Secondary Endpoints
- HFpEF diagnostic competence score change (pre-post case-based assessment)
- HFpEF knowledge acquisition (pre-post validated assessment)
- Commitment-to-change completion rate (immediate post-activity)

### Study Duration and Enrollment
- **Total Study Duration:** 6 months
- **Enrollment Period:** 3 months  
- **Follow-up Duration:** 90 days post-activity
- **Target Enrollment:** 150 practicing cardiologists

## 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### Educational Gap Summary
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately 50% of heart failure cases, yet remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Recent 2024 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors as Class IIa therapy for HFpEF, but real-world adoption has been slow. Evidence gaps exist regarding the effectiveness of targeted CME interventions in improving cardiologists' adherence to evidence-based HFpEF management, particularly SGLT2 inhibitor utilization and systematic comorbidity assessment.

### Rationale for Study
Educational outcomes research is essential for demonstrating CME effectiveness and continuous quality improvement. This study addresses a critical need to evaluate whether case-based educational interventions can successfully translate recent guideline updates into clinical practice.

### Expected Contribution
This study will provide critical evidence on the effectiveness of case-based CME in translating recent HFpEF guidelines into clinical practice, addressing a significant gap in CME outcomes research for this underserved patient population. Results will inform future educational strategy development for guideline implementation and contribute to the limited literature on Moore Level 5 outcomes measurement in cardiovascular CME.

## 3. STUDY OBJECTIVES

### Primary Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of a case-based HFpEF management CME program in improving cardiologists' clinical performance in SGLT2 inhibitor initiation according to 2024 ACC/AHA guidelines, as measured by commitment-to-change implementation rates at 90 days post-intervention.

### Secondary Objectives
1. To assess improvement in clinical competence for identifying comorbidities affecting HFpEF prognosis using validated case-based scenarios
2. To evaluate knowledge retention of HFpEF diagnostic criteria and management strategies at 30 and 90 days post-intervention
3. To measure changes in self-reported confidence in managing HFpEF patients across different clinical presentations
4. To assess barriers and facilitators to implementing SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in clinical practice

### Exploratory Objectives
1. To identify practice setting characteristics associated with higher rates of guideline-concordant SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing
2. To evaluate correlation between knowledge gains and actual practice implementation
3. To assess differences in learning outcomes by years of practice and subspecialty training

## 4. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS

### Study Design
**Design Type:** Single-arm pre-post with longitudinal follow-up

**Design Rationale:** A single-arm pre-post design with 90-day follow-up was selected as the most pragmatic approach for measuring CME outcomes in real-world clinical practice. This design allows for assessment of knowledge acquisition (Moore Level 3), competence demonstration (Moore Level 4), and performance change (Moore Level 5) while being implementable within typical CME operational constraints. Given the specialized nature of HFpEF management and the target audience of cardiologists, a controlled design would be impractical due to contamination risks and ethical considerations.

### Sample Size Calculation
**Target N:** 150 participants

**Power Calculation:** Sample size calculation based on detecting medium effect size (Cohen's d=0.5) for primary knowledge outcome with 80% power and alpha=0.05, requiring 64 completers. Accounting for 40% attrition rate by 90-day follow-up (consistent with CME outcomes literature), we need 107 enrolled participants. To account for initial non-completion and additional dropout, target enrollment of 150 provides adequate buffer while remaining feasible given estimated reach of 500 cardiologists.

**Dropout Assumptions:** 40% attrition expected by 90-day follow-up based on published CME outcomes studies. Higher dropout anticipated between 30-60 days due to clinical practice demands.

## 11. LIMITATIONS

### 11.1 Study Design Limitations
**Single-Arm Design:** Absence of control group limits ability to establish causation and control for temporal trends or external factors affecting practice patterns.

**Self-Reported Outcomes:** Primary outcome relies on self-reported practice implementation, which may be subject to social desirability bias and recall bias.

**Selection Bias:** Participants volunteering for CME research may be more motivated to change practice patterns than the general cardiologist population.

### 11.2 Measurement Limitations
**Follow-up Duration:** 90-day follow-up may be insufficient to assess sustained practice change and long-term patient outcomes.

**Practice Change Verification:** Limited ability to verify self-reported practice changes through objective measures such as prescription databases or medical record review.

**Knowledge Transfer Assessment:** Case-based vignettes may not fully capture real-world clinical decision-making complexity.

### 11.3 Generalizability Limitations
**Participant Population:** Results may not generalize to cardiologists who do not participate in CME activities or practice in significantly different healthcare settings.

**Educational Intervention:** Findings specific to case-based CME format may not apply to other educational modalities or delivery methods.

**Practice Context:** Healthcare system factors, insurance coverage patterns, and regional practice variations may limit generalizability across different settings.

### 11.4 Statistical Limitations
**Multiple Testing:** Multiple secondary outcomes increase risk of Type I error; interpretation will consider adjustment for multiple comparisons.

**Sample Size for Subgroups:** Exploratory subgroup analyses will be underpowered and should be interpreted cautiously.

**Missing Data:** Anticipated 40% dropout rate may introduce bias if dropout is related to outcomes or baseline characteristics.

### 11.5 Mitigation Strategies
**Enhanced Validity Measures:** Use of verification prompts and detailed follow-up questions to improve accuracy of self-reported outcomes.

**Comprehensive Baseline Assessment:** Detailed characterization of participants and practice settings to facilitate appropriate interpretation and comparison with other populations.

**Sensitivity Analyses:** Multiple analytical approaches including best-case/worst-case scenarios and pattern-mixture models for missing data.
