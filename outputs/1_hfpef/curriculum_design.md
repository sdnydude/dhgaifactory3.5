## 4. Case Scenarios

### Case 1: Recognition Challenge
**Clinical Presentation:** 67-year-old woman with diabetes presents to clinic with 6-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Previous echo 18 months ago showed EF 58%. Current visit limited to 15 minutes due to schedule delays. Patient mentions fatigue but attributes it to 'getting older'.

**Decision Points:**
- Decision 1: With limited time, what key questions differentiate HFpEF from other causes of dyspnea?
- Decision 2: Echo scheduling is 6 weeks out - what immediate steps can optimize diagnostic workup?

**Teaching Points:**
- H2FPEF score can guide diagnosis when echo is delayed
- NT-proBNP elevation in HFpEF context and limitations
- Time-efficient history taking focusing on HF-specific symptoms

**Barriers Addressed:** Limited echo access, Symptom overlap

### Case 2: Management Optimization
**Clinical Presentation:** 72-year-old man with newly confirmed HFpEF (EF 52%, elevated filling pressures on echo). Comorbidities include T2DM, CKD stage 3a. You want to initiate SGLT2 inhibitor but patient's insurance requires prior authorization. Patient asks 'why this diabetes drug for my heart?'

**Decision Points:**
- Decision 1: How do you explain SGLT2 inhibitor benefits in HFpEF to both patient and insurance?
- Decision 2: What alternative approaches while waiting for prior auth approval?
- Decision 3: Which SGLT2 inhibitor and what monitoring plan given his CKD?

**Teaching Points:**
- Evidence base for SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF (DELIVER, EMPEROR-Preserved)
- Practical prior authorization strategies and documentation
- Patient communication about pleiotropic drug effects
- Appropriate SGLT2 inhibitor selection and monitoring in CKD

**Barriers Addressed:** Insurance prior auth, Confusing guidelines

### Case 3: Complex Decision Making
**Clinical Presentation:** 78-year-old woman with HFpEF, AFib, moderate CKD presents with worsening symptoms despite ACE inhibitor and diuretic. Three different guidelines suggest different next steps. Patient has had repeated hospitalizations. Insurance approved SGLT2 inhibitor but patient developed recurrent UTIs and stopped it. Family frustrated with 'trial and error' approach.

**Decision Points:**
- Decision 1: How do you prioritize conflicting guideline recommendations in this complex patient?
- Decision 2: What strategies address SGLT2 inhibitor intolerance while maintaining HFpEF benefits?
- Decision 3: How do you communicate treatment rationale to frustrated family while managing their expectations?

**Teaching Points:**
- Reconciling AHA/ACC, ESC, and HFSA guidelines in complex HFpEF
- Alternative approaches when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated
- Shared decision-making in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities

## 6. Innovation Section

This curriculum introduces three groundbreaking innovations specifically designed to address the persistent challenges in HFpEF education and clinical implementation. These innovations represent a significant advancement beyond traditional CME approaches by directly targeting the practical barriers clinicians face in daily practice.

The **Diagnostic Decision Pathway Simulator** represents the first innovation, creating an interactive digital environment where participants navigate real patient scenarios through validated diagnostic algorithms. Unlike static guideline presentations, this simulator allows clinicians to experience the dynamic decision-making process inherent in HFpEF diagnosis. Participants input patient data points including echocardiographic findings, biomarker levels, and comorbidity profiles while receiving immediate feedback on their diagnostic accuracy. The simulator incorporates both H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF scoring systems, allowing side-by-side comparison of how different algorithms perform with identical patient data. This innovation addresses the common clinical challenge where multiple diagnostic pathways exist but practitioners lack experience applying them systematically. The simulator's adaptive questioning technology adjusts the complexity based on participant responses, ensuring personalized learning experiences that target individual knowledge gaps. Real-time validation against evidence-based standards provides immediate corrective feedback, reinforcing optimal diagnostic patterns. The simulator also captures detailed analytics on common diagnostic errors, enabling faculty to identify and address systematic misconceptions during the expert commentary phase.

The **Insurance Navigation Workshop** represents the second innovation, directly confronting one of the most significant barriers to optimal HFpEF management: insurance coverage for evidence-based therapies. This workshop component guides participants through actual prior authorization processes for SGLT2 inhibitors, providing practical tools and language for documentation that maximizes approval likelihood. Unlike theoretical discussions of insurance challenges, this workshop provides hands-on experience with real authorization forms and appeals processes. Participants learn to articulate the specific clinical rationale that resonates with insurance medical directors, including proper documentation of heart failure diagnosis, evidence of symptom burden, and demonstration of guideline-concordant care. The workshop includes sample templates for prior authorization letters, specific ICD-10 coding strategies that support coverage, and escalation procedures for denied requests. This innovation acknowledges that clinical knowledge alone is insufficient if practitioners cannot successfully navigate the administrative barriers that prevent patient access to recommended therapies. The workshop also addresses patient communication strategies for explaining insurance delays and alternative approaches during authorization periods, ensuring continuity of care planning even when preferred medications are temporarily unavailable.

The **Phenotype-Specific Patient Avatars** represent the third innovation, utilizing detailed patient personas that embody the heterogeneous presentations of HFpEF across different demographic and comorbidity profiles. These avatars go beyond simple case vignettes by incorporating the complex interplay of age, gender, comorbidities, and social determinants that influence both diagnosis and treatment decisions in real-world practice. Each avatar includes detailed backstories covering previous healthcare encounters, medication adherence patterns, insurance status, and family dynamics that affect treatment acceptance and implementation. The avatars are designed to represent the most common HFpEF phenotypes encountered in clinical practice: the elderly woman with diabetes and obesity, the middle-aged man with hypertension and sleep apnea, and the complex patient with multiple comorbidities and previous heart failure hospitalizations. Throughout the educational session, participants follow these avatars through diagnostic and treatment decisions, experiencing how the same evidence-based approach must be adapted for different patient contexts. This innovation addresses the challenge that HFpEF management cannot follow a one-size-fits-all approach, requiring nuanced clinical reasoning that considers patient-specific factors. The avatars evolve during the session, presenting new clinical developments that require adaptive management strategies, mimicking the longitudinal nature of chronic disease care.

These three innovations work synergistically to create a comprehensive learning experience that bridges the gap between evidence-based knowledge and practical implementation. The Diagnostic Decision Pathway Simulator builds foundational competency in systematic diagnosis, the Insurance Navigation Workshop removes administrative barriers to treatment implementation, and the Phenotype-Specific Patient Avatars provide context for individualized care decisions. Together, they address the complete spectrum of challenges clinicians face in HFpEF management, from initial recognition through long-term optimization. This comprehensive approach ensures that participants leave the educational session with not only updated clinical knowledge but also practical tools and strategies for immediate implementation in their practice settings.
