### 5. Treatment Response Monitoring
**Moore Level 5 (Performance)**  
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **monitor** natriuretic peptide levels and functional status in patients with HFpEF receiving new therapies to optimize treatment response and prevent clinical deterioration.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses insufficient systematic monitoring by targeting structured follow-up and objective monitoring after treatment initiation.

**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with 60-day follow-up targeting ≥70% of participants reporting implementation of systematic monitoring protocols for HFpEF patients.

### 6. Differential Diagnosis Competence
**Moore Level 4 (Competence)**  
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **differentiate** between HFpEF, HFrEF, and non-cardiac causes of dyspnea in patients presenting with heart failure symptoms to reduce diagnostic delays and improve time to appropriate therapy.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses delayed diagnosis of HFpEF by developing diagnostic reasoning skills to distinguish HFpEF from similar conditions.

**Measurement:** Pre/post case-based assessment with 30-day retention testing, targeting ≥80% correct diagnostic categorization across 5 case scenarios.

### 7. SGLT2 Inhibitor Selection and Timing
**Moore Level 4 (Competence)**  
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **determine** optimal SGLT2 inhibitor selection and timing in patients with newly diagnosed HFpEF to maximize cardiovascular benefits and minimize adverse effects.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses underutilization of SGLT2 inhibitors by building competence in clinical decision-making for therapeutic selection.

**Measurement:** Pre/post case-based assessment with 60-day follow-up targeting ≥85% appropriate SGLT2 inhibitor selection in complex patient scenarios.

### 8. Complex Medical Therapy Evaluation
**Moore Level 4 (Competence)**  
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to **evaluate** the appropriateness of guideline-directed medical therapy combinations in HFpEF patients with multiple comorbidities to optimize treatment outcomes while minimizing drug interactions.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses underutilization of evidence-based therapies by developing competence in integrating complex therapeutic regimens.

**Measurement:** Case-based assessment using standardized patient scenarios targeting ≥80% appropriate therapeutic combination recommendations.
