# Learning Objectives Document: Chronic Cough Management CME Activity

## Executive Summary

**Target Moore Level:** Level 5 (Performance)  
**Primary Audience:** Pulmonologists and specialists managing chronic cough patients  

**Moore Level Distribution:**
- Level 4 (Competence): 3 objectives (43%)
- Level 5 (Performance): 4 objectives (57%)

This distribution targets Level 5 performance changes based on gap barrier analysis, emphasizing actual practice implementation while building necessary competence in clinical reasoning and therapeutic decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Standardized Assessment Implementation
**Moore Level 5 - Performance | Verb: implement**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to implement standardized chronic cough assessment protocols including validated cough severity scales for adult patients with cough lasting ≥8 weeks to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment selection.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inconsistent chronic cough evaluation practices leading to delayed diagnosis  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with 60-day follow-up; Success criteria: ≥70% report implementing standardized protocols

### 2. Evidence-Based Prescribing
**Moore Level 5 - Performance | Verb: prescribe**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to prescribe evidence-based first-line therapies based on underlying etiology for patients with chronic refractory cough to optimize symptom control and quality of life outcomes.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses suboptimal treatment selection and inappropriate therapy use  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with 60-day follow-up; Success criteria: ≥75% report prescribing evidence-based first-line therapies

### 3. Systematic Monitoring Initiation
**Moore Level 5 - Performance | Verb: initiate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to initiate systematic monitoring protocols using validated outcome measures for patients receiving chronic cough treatment to track therapeutic response and guide treatment modifications.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses inadequate treatment monitoring and lack of systematic follow-up  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with 60-day follow-up; Success criteria: ≥70% report initiating structured monitoring protocols

### 4. Appropriate Subspecialty Referrals
**Moore Level 5 - Performance | Verb: refer**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to refer patients with unexplained chronic cough to appropriate subspecialty care or multidisciplinary cough clinics to ensure comprehensive evaluation and specialized treatment options.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses delayed or inappropriate referrals for complex cases  
**Measurement:** Commitment-to-change with 60-day follow-up; Success criteria: ≥65% report implementing systematic referral criteria

### 5. Chronic Cough Phenotype Differentiation
**Moore Level 4 - Competence | Verb: differentiate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to differentiate between refractory chronic cough and other chronic cough phenotypes using diagnostic criteria and treatment response patterns for patients with persistent cough symptoms to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce time to appropriate therapy.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses failure to identify refractory chronic cough phenotypes  
**Measurement:** Case-based assessment with 30-day retention; Success criteria: ≥80% correct classification in case scenarios

### 6. Neuromodulatory Therapy Candidacy Assessment
**Moore Level 4 - Competence | Verb: evaluate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to evaluate patient candidacy for neuromodulatory therapies by assessing clinical presentation, comorbidities, and treatment history for patients with refractory chronic cough to optimize therapeutic selection and improve symptom control.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses limited awareness of neuromodulatory therapy applications  
**Measurement:** Case-based assessment with 30-day retention; Success criteria: ≥85% appropriate candidate selection

### 7. Evidence-Based Treatment Algorithm Development
**Moore Level 4 - Competence | Verb: formulate**

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to formulate evidence-based treatment algorithms for chronic cough management incorporating conventional therapies and neuromodulatory options for patients across the chronic cough spectrum to standardize care and improve treatment outcomes.

**Gap Alignment:** Addresses failure to identify refractory cases through systematic approaches  
**Measurement:** Case-based assessment with 30-day retention; Success criteria: ≥80% accuracy in treatment sequence development
