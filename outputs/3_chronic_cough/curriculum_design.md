## Case Scenarios

### CASE-01: Recognition Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 45-year-old teacher presents with 8-week dry cough following upper respiratory infection. Initial workup including chest X-ray, spirometry, and methacholine challenge test normal. Patient tried ACE inhibitor cessation, PPI therapy, and antihistamines without improvement. Continues to have disruptive cough affecting work performance.

**Key Decision Points:**
- At what point does this become refractory chronic cough requiring specialized evaluation?
- What additional diagnostic steps are warranted before considering neuromodulatory approaches?

**Teaching Focus:** Recognition criteria for refractory chronic cough after standard treatment failure, timeline expectations for traditional therapies, impact assessment beyond symptom severity

### CASE-02: Management Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 58-year-old accountant with 18-month history of chronic cough. Previous pulmonologist tried comprehensive workup including HRCT, bronchoscopy, and 24-hour pH monitoring - all normal. Patient failed trials of inhaled corticosteroids, gabapentin, and speech therapy. Insurance initially denied coverage for newer neuromodulatory agent. Patient's productivity declining, considering early retirement.

**Key Decision Points:**
- How do you navigate insurance barriers for newer neuromodulatory therapies in your practice?
- What evidence do you present to justify moving beyond traditional gabapentin to newer agents?

**Teaching Focus:** Real-world insurance authorization challenges, evidence base supporting P2X3 antagonists, patient selection criteria, documentation strategies

### CASE-03: Complex Decision Scenario
**Clinical Presentation:** 62-year-old with refractory chronic cough, mild COPD (FEV1 75%), GERD on PPI therapy, and suspected upper airway cough syndrome. Patient has partial response to multiple interventions but continues having breakthrough episodes. Recent trial of gefapixant showed modest improvement but experienced taste disturbance. Referring physician pressuring for 'definitive solution' while patient expectations remain high.

**Key Decision Points:**
- How do you manage competing etiologies when neuromodulatory therapy shows partial response?
- How do you balance efficacy expectations with realistic outcomes in complex cases?
- What role does combination therapy play when single interventions provide incomplete relief?

**Teaching Focus:** Managing multiple contributing factors, realistic expectations, combination therapy approaches, patient communication strategies

## Innovation Section

This curriculum represents a significant advancement in chronic cough medical education through three groundbreaking educational innovations that directly address the complex clinical reality pulmonologists face in managing this challenging condition.

**Authentic Acoustic Case Studies** transform traditional case-based learning by incorporating actual cough sound recordings alongside conventional clinical data. This innovation addresses a critical gap in chronic cough education where physicians typically rely on patient descriptions rather than objective acoustic analysis. The curriculum includes professionally recorded cough samples from patients with different etiologies, enabling participants to develop pattern recognition skills that translate directly to clinical practice. Each audio segment is synchronized with corresponding diagnostic findings, treatment responses, and patient-reported outcomes, creating a multi-dimensional learning experience that mirrors real clinical encounters. This approach has proven particularly effective in helping clinicians differentiate between productive and non-productive coughs, identify cough patterns associated with specific underlying conditions, and correlate acoustic findings with treatment responsiveness.

**Collaborative Algorithm Navigation** revolutionizes how clinicians learn to apply complex diagnostic algorithms by creating hybrid learning environments where live and virtual participants work together through structured decision-making processes. Rather than passive algorithm review, participants engage in active problem-solving using the ATS/ERS chronic cough diagnostic guidelines applied to authentic patient scenarios. The innovation lies in the seamless integration of in-person collaborative groups with virtual breakout rooms, enabling broader participation while maintaining the benefits of peer learning and diverse perspective sharing. Each group receives the same clinical case but approaches it from different starting points in the algorithm, then shares their diagnostic pathways and rationales with other groups. This cross-pollination of approaches helps participants understand algorithm flexibility, recognize decision point variations, and develop confidence in systematic chronic cough evaluation.

**Dynamic Evidence Integration Stations** create an immersive learning environment where participants access and apply the latest chronic cough research in real-time clinical scenarios. These stations combine current literature with practice-based decision-making, allowing clinicians to experience how emerging evidence impacts patient care decisions. Each station focuses on specific aspects of chronic cough management, from traditional gabapentin approaches to newer P2X3 antagonist therapies like gefapixant. Participants rotate through stations that present different clinical challenges requiring evidence-based treatment decisions, with immediate access to relevant research data, clinical trial results, and expert consensus statements. The dynamic aspect involves real-time updates to reflect the most current evidence and the ability for participants to input their own clinical experiences and outcomes data.

These innovations work synergistically to create a comprehensive learning experience that goes far beyond traditional lecture-based continuing medical education. The combination of authentic acoustic analysis, collaborative algorithm application, and dynamic evidence integration creates multiple learning pathways that accommodate different learning styles while ensuring all participants engage with the material at a deep, clinically relevant level. The hybrid format ensures accessibility for busy clinicians while maintaining the collaborative benefits essential for complex clinical decision-making skills.

The educational impact extends beyond individual knowledge acquisition to practice transformation. By working through realistic scenarios using actual diagnostic tools and current evidence, participants develop both technical competence and clinical confidence in managing chronic cough patients. The collaborative elements foster peer learning networks that continue beyond the formal educational session, creating ongoing professional development opportunities and consultation relationships.
