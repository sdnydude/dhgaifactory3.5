## 2. Background and Rationale

### 2.1 Educational Gap Summary

Chronic cough affects 9-33% of the population globally, representing one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Refractory chronic cough cases cause significant patient morbidity, decreased quality of life, and substantial healthcare utilization. Despite recent advances in understanding cough hypersensitivity syndromes and the approval of neuromodulatory therapies, pulmonologists report low confidence in managing refractory cases and demonstrate limited awareness of newer therapeutic options.

Current evidence indicates that this educational gap leads to:
- Prolonged diagnostic odysseys for patients
- Suboptimal utilization of evidence-based diagnostic algorithms
- Underutilization of approved neuromodulatory therapies
- Inappropriate referral patterns and healthcare resource utilization
- Poor patient outcomes and satisfaction

### 2.2 Rationale for Study

Educational outcomes research is essential for demonstrating CME effectiveness and enabling continuous quality improvement in medical education. The lack of evidence-based data on educational interventions targeting chronic cough management represents a significant gap in the medical education literature.

### 2.3 Expected Contribution

This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of targeted CME in improving pulmonologist competence and performance in refractory chronic cough management. The research addresses a critical knowledge gap in respiratory medicine education outcomes research and will inform future educational interventions in this underserved clinical area.

## 3. Study Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of a chronic cough CME intervention in improving pulmonologists' clinical performance in diagnosing and managing refractory chronic cough patients, as measured by commitment-to-change implementation rates at 60 days post-intervention.

### 3.2 Secondary Objectives

1. To assess change in clinical competence in applying systematic diagnostic algorithms for chronic cough using case-based performance scenarios
2. To evaluate knowledge retention of neuromodulatory therapy options for refractory chronic cough at 60 days post-intervention
3. To measure self-reported confidence in managing refractory chronic cough cases
4. To document practice pattern changes in diagnostic workup duration and therapeutic approaches

### 3.3 Exploratory Objectives

1. To identify barriers to implementing neuromodulatory therapies in clinical practice
2. To assess correlation between knowledge gains and actual practice change implementation
3. To evaluate differences in outcomes based on years in practice and practice setting characteristics

---

## 4. Study Design and Methods

### 4.1 Study Design

This is a prospective, single-arm, pre-post educational outcomes study with longitudinal follow-up conducted over 6 months.

### 4.2 Design Rationale

A single-arm pre-post design is most appropriate for this CME outcomes study given operational constraints and the educational intervention context. This design allows measurement of knowledge and competence changes while being pragmatic for implementation. The longitudinal follow-up component enables assessment of sustained learning and performance changes, which is critical for demonstrating educational impact beyond immediate post-activity measures.

While a controlled design would strengthen causal inference, randomizing practicing pulmonologists to different educational interventions presents significant feasibility and ethical challenges in the CME context.

### 4.3 Study Duration

- **Enrollment Period:** 3 months
- **Follow-up Duration:** 120 days post-activity
- **Total Study Duration:** 6 months

## 5. Study Population

### 5.1 Inclusion Criteria

1. Board-certified pulmonologist or pulmonary medicine fellow
2. Currently managing patients with chronic cough in clinical practice
3. Minimum 10 chronic cough patients seen per month
4. Access to electronic medical records for follow-up data collection
5. Consent to participate in pre/post assessments and follow-up

### 5.2 Exclusion Criteria

1. Participated in chronic cough-focused CME within past 6 months
2. Not currently in active clinical practice
3. Primarily research-focused role without patient care responsibilities
4. Unable to commit to 120-day follow-up participation

### 5.3 Sample Size Calculation

**Target Sample Size:** 160 participants

**Power Calculation:** Sample size calculation based on detecting medium effect size (Cohen's d=0.5) in paired t-test with 80% power and alpha=0.05, requiring 64 paired observations. Accounting for 40% attrition rate typical in CME follow-up studies, target enrollment is 160 participants to ensure adequate power for primary outcomes.

**Dropout Assumptions:** 40% attrition expected by 120-day follow-up based on published CME outcomes research. Higher retention anticipated for 60-day measures (~25% attrition). Dropout analysis will compare baseline characteristics between completers and non-completers to assess potential bias.
